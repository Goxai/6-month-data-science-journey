# Day 42

# i started and completed the bank customer churn data project

# Business Problem
The bank has experienced customer churn and wants to understand the key drivers behind
customers leaving in order to design effective retention strategies

# Data Overview
The dataset contains customer demographics and financial behavior including age, gender,
country, account balance, estimated salary, credit score, and whether the customer is an active
member. The target variable is 'churn' (1 = exited, 0 = stayed)

# Key Findings
• Older (elderly) customers have the highest churn rate (~40%), making age a strong predictor of
churn.
• Female customers churn more (~25%) than male customers (~16%).
• Inactive members are far more likely to churn (~27%) than active members (~14%).
• Customers in Germany have roughly double the churn rate of those in France or Spain.
• Estimated salary shows little relationship with churn.
• Customers with higher account balances churn more than those with lower balances.
• Credit score has minimal impact on churn

# Overall Insight
Churn is primarily driven by age, inactivity, and high account balance. Germany's higher churn is
largely explained by its older, less active, and higher-balance customer profile rather than salary or
credit score differences.


# Recommendations
• Target older customers with personalized retention offers.
• Encourage activity through rewards, reminders, and engagement programs.
• Monitor high-balance customers more closely and provide premium support.
• Focus retention efforts especially in Germany
