# Day 31

## Exploratory Data Analysis & Outlier Treatment

### ✅ Topics Covered
- NumPy statistical operations (percentiles, IQR)
- Outlier detection using the IQR method
- Winsorization to handle extreme but realistic values
- Handling missing values using median imputation
- Data visualization with Matplotlib (histograms, boxplots, comparisons)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow

### 🛠 Practical Work
- Analyzed customer spending and salary datasets
- Identified skewed distributions and extreme values
- Applied winsorization instead of removal for realistic outliers
- Compared distributions before and after outlier treatment using boxplots
- Built an end-to-end EDA workflow suitable for a portfolio project

### 🧠 Key Learnings
- Outliers should not always be removed; context matters
- Winsorization preserves dataset size while reducing skewness
- Median is safer than mean when handling missing values in skewed data
- Visualization is critical for validating data-cleaning decisions

### 📌 Next Steps
- Convert EDA into a GitHub-ready portfolio project
- Practice Seaborn visualizations
- Explore customer segmentation techniques
