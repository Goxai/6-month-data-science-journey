# Day 34
# Titanic EDA 

# What I Learned / Did Today:

### Loaded and explored Titanic dataset using Pandas

### Understood column meanings and data types

### Checked missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)

### Filled missing Age using median, Embarked using mode

### Visualized distributions:

### Age (histogram, boxplot)

### Fare (histogram, boxplot)

### Compared categorical data:

### Survival counts (bar chart)

### Survival by gender (bar chart)

### Used side-by-side boxplots to compare Age by survival

### Key Insight:

### EDA is about asking questions and visualizing them before cleaning or modeling

# Next Step:

### Analyze multi-variable relationships (Class + Gender + Age + Fare)
