# Day 36
## i started and completed the House Prices EDAproject

- Detected and analyzed outliers using scatter plots  
- Used NumPy Boolean masking to inspect and remove extreme anomalies  
- Applied winsorization to reduce skew while preserving data  
- Compared distributions before and after outlier handling  
- Wrote clear, portfolio-ready EDA insights and conclusions  

# Final analysis
## Exploratory analysis shows that SalePrice is heavily right-skewed and benefits from log transformation.
## Living area and overall quality have strong positive relationships with price.
## Several features contained missing values representing absence rather than data errors.
## Extreme outliers in living area were removed to improve model stability.
