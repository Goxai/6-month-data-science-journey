# Day 32 – NumPy Deep Dive

### What I Learned
- Advanced Boolean masking for filtering, counting, and conditional updates
- Using multiple conditions with NumPy logical operators
- Broadcasting rules and shape alignment
- Row-wise and column-wise operations using `reshape`
- Combining masking and broadcasting for efficient data preprocessing

### Key Takeaway
Boolean masking and broadcasting eliminate loops and are essential for fast, clean NumPy-based data analysis.

### Next
NumPy reshaping and advanced Matplotlib.
