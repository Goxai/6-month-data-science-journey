# Day 33 – EDA Visuals with NumPy & Matplotlib

### What I Worked On
- Built Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visuals using NumPy and Matplotlib
- Created and analyzed histograms to understand data distribution and skewness
- Used boxplots to detect and reason about outliers
- Handled missing values using median imputation
- Applied winsorization to cap extreme values instead of removing data
- Compared distributions before and after cleaning using side-by-side visuals
- Used annotations to highlight insights in plots

### What I’m Understanding Better
- EDA is not about plotting randomly, but asking questions with visuals
- Boxplots and histograms complement each other for understanding distributions
- Winsorization helps preserve dataset size while reducing the impact of outliers
- Visual comparison is essential to validate data-cleaning decisions

### Questions & Challenges
- I still have questions about choosing the right number of bins in histograms
- I want to better understand how to interpret subtle changes after winsorization
- I’m learning how to decide *which* visual is best for a specific data question

### Key Takeaway
EDA is an iterative thinking process. Asking questions, visualizing, adjusting, and validating decisions is more important than getting everything “right” immediately.

### Next Steps
- Practice EDA visuals with more datasets
- Move into multi-variable EDA (scatter plots and relationships)
- Improve confidence in interpreting plots and drawing insights
