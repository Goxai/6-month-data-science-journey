# Student Performance Project

This mini project analyzes a simple dataset of four students using:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Contents
1. The dataset (created manually)
2. Data filtering (pass/fail, name selection, score-only selection)
3. Data visualization:
   - Line chart
   - Bar chart
   - Histogram

## Goal
This project is part of my daily data science practice.  
It helps me build confidence in:
- DataFrames  
- Data cleaning  
- Visualization  
- Working with Jupyter Notebook  

## Files
- `student_performance.ipynb` — the main notebook
