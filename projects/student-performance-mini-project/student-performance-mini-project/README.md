# Project discreption
This project analyzes the performance of students using Python. 
The program reads student names and scores, calculates their averages, 
and visualizes the results using bar charts and histograms.


# Student Performance Project

This mini project analyzes a simple dataset of four students using:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Contents
1. The dataset (created manually)
2. Data filtering (pass/fail, name selection, score-only selection)
3. Data visualization:
   - Line chart
   - Bar chart
   - Histogram

## Goal
This project is part of my daily data science practice.  
It helps me build confidence in:
- DataFrames  
- Data cleaning  
- Visualization  
- Working with Jupyter Notebook
## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains two columns:

- **name** – the name of each student  
- **score** – the performance score of the student

Example:

| name  | score |
|-------|--------|
| Alice | 90     |
| Bob   | 85     |
| John  | 88     |
| Mary  | 92     |

## Analysis Summary

The goal of this analysis was to:

- Read student names and scores
- Calculate each student’s average score
- Visualize the results with bar charts and histograms

From the dataset:

- **Mary** had the highest score
- **Bob** had the lowest score
- Most students scored between 85 and 95

## Conclusion

This project helped me practice fundamental Python concepts such as:
- Lists and dictionaries
- Loops and conditional statements
- Basic data analysis
- Data visualization with Matplotlib

It represents my progress in learning Python for data science and will be expanded with more advanced analysis in the future.
