# Today i started and completed the Telco customer churn dataset project.

# TELECOM CHURN — FINAL ANALYTICAL REPORT

## Business Question
Why are customers leaving (churning), and what should management prioritize to reduce churn?

## Key Findings (What the data actually shows)

## 1) Internet Service — STRONGEST DRIVER

Fiber optic customers churn the most (~42%), far higher than DSL (~19%) and No internet (~7%).

This signals quality, speed, or reliability problems with Fiber service, not customer behavior.

## Conclusion:
Poor internet experience is a primary cause of churn.

## 2) Tech Support — CRITICAL FACTOR

Customers without tech support churn ~42%, compared to ~15% when support is available.

Customers with “No internet service” almost never churn.

## Conclusion:
Lack of accessible and effective tech support is pushing customers away.

## 3) Online Security — MAJOR ISSUE

No online security → ~42% churn

With online security → ~15% churn

## Conclusion:
Customers value security. Not offering it widely increases churn.

## 4) Monthly Charges — PRICE SENSITIVITY EXISTS

High monthly charges → ~35% churn

Mid → ~24%

Low → ~12%

## Conclusion:
High prices increase churn, but price is NOT the main problem — service quality is.

## 5) Senior Citizens — HIGH-RISK GROUP

Senior citizens churn ~42% vs ~24% for non-seniors.

## Interpretation:
Older users likely struggle with:

Complex plans

Poor support

Technology issues

They leave faster when frustrated.

## 6) Gender — NOT IMPORTANT

Male and female churn rates are almost identical.

Gender does NOT drive churn.

## 7) TotalCharges — MISLEADING IF USED ALONE

Low TotalCharges customers churn more because they are new customers (short tenure), not because they paid less.

The real issue = early customer experience, not total money spent.

## What Really Causes Churn (Ranked)

Internet service quality (Fiber issues) — #1 problem

Lack of tech support — #2 problem

No online security — #3 problem

High monthly charges — secondary factor

Senior citizen experience — needs special care

Gender — irrelevant

# Your Corrected Business Recommendation (stronger version)

Instead of “lower price first,” the data supports this order:

## Step 1 — Fix the product (most important)

Improve Fiber reliability and speed

Reduce outages and buffering

Monitor complaints from Fiber users

## Step 2 — Strengthen support

More customer support agents

Faster response time

Dedicated help for seniors

## Step 3 — Expand Online Security

Offer it by default or at low cost

Market it clearly as a safety benefit

## Step 4 — Only then consider price changes

Reduce prices only after service improves

Otherwise you lose money without reducing churn.

# One-line takeaway for management

“Customers are not leaving because of price — they are leaving because the internet quality and support experience are poor.”
