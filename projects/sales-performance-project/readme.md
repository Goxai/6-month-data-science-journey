# Project discreption
This project analyzes the performance of sales using Python. 
The program reads products names, region and price, calculates their sales per region, sales per product and total sales 
and visualizes the results using bar charts.


# sales Performance Project

This mini project analyzes a simple dataset of four students using:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Contents
1. The dataset (created manually)
2. Data filtering (sales by region, sales by products)
3. Data visualization:
   - Bar chart

## Goal
This project is part of my daily data science practice.  
It helps me build confidence in:
- DataFrames  
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis 
- Visualization  
- Working with Jupyter Notebook
## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains three columns:

- **product** – the name of products 
- **region** – the region sales of products took place
- **sales** - the sales of product

## Analysis Summary

The goal of this analysis was to:

- Read products name, region and sales
- Calculate each totals sales
- Visualize the results with bar charts

From the dataset:


- **Laptop** had the highest sales across each regions
- **Tablet** had the lowest sale across each region

## Conclusion

This project helped me practice fundamental Python concepts such as:
- pnadas basic functions like:
- group by
- sum
- sort values
- Basic data analysis
- Data visualization with Matplotlib

- ## Result i got from the dataset
- from my analysis so far, Laptop performed the best across the three different regions having a total sales of 3100
- North made the most money with a sale of 2400
